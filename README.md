#CacheStash

###CacheStash is a location storing service for hiding buried treasure, orienteering, or remembering how to get home!

After registering an account, you can search for your latitude and longitude via JavaScript and API call. With another API call you can reverse look up your street and town name. All of that is securely saved in our database. When you view your caches, you’ll see a map of your location provided by an API call.  You can comment yours and other people’s cache. You are also able to edit and delete any cache or comment that you create.

Styled with CSS and Bootstrap, the app is fully deployed on AWS and has a SSL certificate that allows DNS forwarding and a secure connection, which is required for the location service.
